## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Sass/Scss
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/) - Official Sass documentation

### Steps to run locally

#### Setup

1. Clone the project in a local directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thalesAlves758/sunnyside-agency-landing-page
```

2. Download the development dependencies (in this case is Sass):
```bash
npm i
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**Notes**:
- Make sure you have Node installed on your computer.

#### Execution

1. Once the installation has been done correctly, run the following command to generate the .css files:
```bash
npm run sass:watch
```

2. Open the index.html file. If you are using vscode, it's recommended to use the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to make it easier.

That's it, the landing page is running locally. üôÇ
